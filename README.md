# BSim - Behaviour Simulator

__The Behaviour Simulator is an agent-based model framework designed as a plugin for Rhino software. This implementation offers a lightweight and easily customizable system, enabling users to define agent behaviors and explore system dynamics through simulations. The development is implemented as a plug-in for the CAD environment [McNeel Rhino/Grasshopper](https://www.rhino3d.com/) for both Windows and MacOS.__

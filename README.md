# BSim - Behaviour Simulator

The Behaviour Simulator is an agent-based model framework designed as a plugin for Rhino software. This implementation offers a lightweight and easily customizable system, enabling users to define agent behaviors and explore system dynamics through simulations. The development is implemented as a plug-in for the CAD environment [McNeel Rhino/Grasshopper](https://www.rhino3d.com/) for both Windows and MacOS.

## Quick Start:
An ABM system can be setted with:

```C#
// import the namespace of BSim.dll:
using BSim;

//Construt a ABM class with four inputs [ISpace] [Event] [Person] [Communicate];
ABM AgentBasedModel = new ABM(ISpaces, Event, Person, Communicate);

//You can run the simulation with:

if (Reset)
    {
     //refresh the system
      ABM_simu = (ABM) Model; //nominate the ABM as ABM_simu
      agentCount = ABM_simu.PPs_Wait.Count;
    }
    else if(Run)
    {
      if(ABM_simu != null && ABM_simu.PS.iteration < MaxIter && ABM_simu.PPs_Sink.Count < agentCount)
      {
        try{
          Print(ABM_simu.Simulate(Reset, out timeRep));
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
          Print(e.ToString());
        }
      }
    }

//
```
